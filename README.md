Solution uses .Net 6.0 and UnitTest Project use MSTest. 
Code Coverage report is generated with FineCodeCoverage tool. 
Source code added in Git with public rights. Library havnâ€™t any dependencies. 
Unit Test project having Moq(4.18.1) and Microsoft.NET.Test.SDk(16.11.0) dependencies.
SonarQube Integration for Code Analysis.
```



## Race Solution consist fo 3 Projects.

- RaceSetUpLibrary : Core Logic is written under this. Interface ICarSetUp having SetCarRanks for calculating the car ranks on race completion time.
- RaceTestProject : This is unit test project for RaceSetUpLibrary. % different test method are written to test the logic of the code. 80% code coverage is done. Report is generated with the help of FineCodeCoverage tool.
- Race: This is console app, which use the RaceSetUpLibrary. This is just for demonstrate the usage of the SetCarRanks method. It generate the output like below:
